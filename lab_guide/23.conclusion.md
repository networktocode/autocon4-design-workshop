# 23. Lab 2 Conclusion

You have successfully used Nautobot to deploy a digital twin of a site in ContainerLab and bootstrapped the startup config from intented configs generated by Golden Config! 

Wasn't that so much more fun than applying those configs manually? We now have a full digital twin generated from our Network Source of Truth. We can use this lab environment to test our config changes prior to pushing them to their prod counterparts. 

Up next is exploring how we can use the NUTS (Network Unit Test System) to validate config changes!
