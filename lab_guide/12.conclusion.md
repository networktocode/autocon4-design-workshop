# 12. Lab 1 Conclusion

You have successfully used Nautobot's Design Builder App to generate a new site's intent data from a design file! 

This is all the time we have today to play with the Design Builder App, but hopefully you can see all the potential use cases. Please explore the files for the `Branch Design` ("/jobs/branch/"). The `context.yaml` file has a hardcoded variable that is referenced in the design. The `__init__.py` file defines the `BranchContext` class where we define utility fuctions and properties that server as dynamic variables that are also referenced in the design. We also use additional action tags such as `!ref` which can be very helpful and simplify your designs.

Design builder has a few additional features that we don't really touch on in this workshop. You can read all about them in the docs at [https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/design-builder/en/latest/](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/design-builder/en/latest/)

Now let continue, next up is deploying a digital twin with Container Lab!
