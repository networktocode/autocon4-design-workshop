### >>> Design Builder
- a Nautobot App for creating objects based on designs
- basically a YAML to Nautobot object converter
- ...but with Jinja2 templating
- ...and with extra superpowers!

---
<!-- _header: Design Builder YAML structure -->

```yaml
---
# Simple statement
tenants:
  - name: "Autocon4"

# Nested statement (child inherits parent)
providers:
  - name: "NTC"
    provider_networks:
      - name: "NTC-WAN"

# Deep attributes with dunder
locations:
  - name: "Austin"
    location_type__name: "Region"
    status__name: "Active"
```

<!-- _header: Design Builder now with Jinja2 -->

```yaml

# For loop
locations:
{% for i in range(1, 4) %}
  - name: "Austin0{{ i }}"
    location_type__name: "Region"
