### >>> what is a source of truth?
- *"everything you need to know in order to build your whole network from the ground up"*

---
<!-- _header: but first a little bit of theory -->

### >>> what is a digital twin?
- a virtual representation of a physical object or system
- simulate, analyze, optimize the physical counterpart
- test new designs and configurations

---
<!-- _header: but first a little bit of theory -->

### >>> what is test-driven development?
- process "borowed" from software development
- write tests before writing code/configuration
- tests are used to validate configs before deploying

<!-- _header: but first a little bit of theory -->

### >>> what is a golden config?
- a configuration artifact generated from the SoT
- also the name of the respective nautobot plugin
- useful for deploying configs and compliance (does my running config match the golden config?)
